We learn about the basics of Quantum Communication and Quantum Cryptrography, both of these technology are implemented on small scale quantum computer which can perform smaller distance quantum communication and quantum cryptography. Thus it is a challenge to perform the quantum communication and quantum cryptography over larger distance i.e between any two point on earth at least.

In This chapter we learn about the quantum protocol which will be used for the encryption of quantum states.

### Density Metrices

Density Metrices are the general form of writing quantum states from vector to matrix form.

Q. How to write down the states of the one of the several qubits ?

Let's assume that we have two quantum systems A and B i.e A and B are the two qubits in joint states $\ket \psi_{AB} = \ket \psi_A tensorproduct \ket \psi_B$. and we want to know about the state of qubit A i.e $\ket \psi_A$.

Q. Wheather we can write quantum state of multiple quantum systems into superposition of tensor product of the single qubits of each quantum systems ?

Let's take a quantum state i.e EPR pair 

$$
\ket {EPR}_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \ket 0_A \ket 0_B + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \ket 1_A \ket 1_B
$$

such quantum states can't be represeted as superposition of tensorproduct of quantum states of every quantum system i.e $\ket \psi_{AB} = \ket \psi_A tensorproduct \ket \psi_B$. 

Thus it is unclear how to express the state of A without any reference to the state of B. If we can't write down such states into our vector mechanism then it's does not mean that state does't exits actually it exits and our mechanism is incomplete. Hence we needed to find a mathematical generalization for this task.

Note : In  a measurement of quantum state the probabilistic process prepares the different states with some probability i.e state $\ket \psi_1 \; with \; p_1$ and state $\ket \psi_2 \; with \; p_2$ i.e $\{\ket \psi_i, p_i\}$. Can we write down general mathematical for of states created by such process ?
