    "# Quantum Fourier Transform from Theoretical to Practical Perspective\n",
    "After, reading the title of the article students have lots of questions like What is Fourier Transform and What is Fourier Series ? and how these classical computational concepts are applied to the quantum computation ? We will explore it from the classical to the quantum theoretical and practical aspects."
